# baseless v0.1

## A Base less styles structure.

Baseless is designed to help developers (and designers) in prototyping web apps and web sites. Baseless provides all the simple styling you will need to mock up a quick working prototype, and will help you quickly tweak the styles when you do have more time.

There are too many "grid systems" and bootstraps that don't actually help you get anything done. You spend all your time figuring out how to use them, with baseless just write markup your way and see it simple styled before your eyes! If you want to float a column or make something fluid - you do it!

## Getting started

Give baseless a download and have a look at the example.
